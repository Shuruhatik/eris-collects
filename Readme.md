## Installation

You can install the **eris-collects** package using npm:
```bash
npm install eris-collects
```

## Usage
Here is an example of how to use the **eris-collects** package to create an interaction collector:

```javascript
const { InteractionCollector } = require('eris-collects');

// Create an instance of the collector
const collector = new InteractionCollector(client, {
  channel: channel, // The channel to collect interactions from
  filter: (interaction) => interaction.data.name === 'ping', // Optional filter function
  time: 60000 // Optional time limit in milliseconds
});

// Listen for the 'collect' event
collector.on('collect', (interaction) => {
  console.log(`Collected interaction ${interaction.id}`);
});

// Listen for the 'end' event
collector.on('end', (interactions, reason) => {
  console.log(`Collector ended. Collected ${interactions.length} interactions. Reason: ${reason}`);
});

// Stop the collector manually
collector.stop("reason");
```

## API
### `new InteractionCollector(client, options)`

Creates a new instance of the InteractionCollector.
- `client` (required): The Eris client instance.
- `options` (required): An object containing the following properties:
  - `channel` (optional): The channel to collect interactions from.
  - `filter` (optional): A function that acts as a filter for the collected interactions. Only interactions that pass the filter will be collected.
  - `time` (optional): The time limit in milliseconds. The collector will automatically stop after the specified time.

### `collector.on(event, listener)`
Adds an event listener to the collector.
- `event`: The name of the event to listen for. Supported events:
  - `'collect'`: Emitted when an interaction is collected. The listener receives the collected interaction as an argument.
  - `'end'`: Emitted when the collector ends. The listener receives the collected interactions and the reason for ending as arguments.
- `listener`: The function to be called when the event is emitted.

### `collector.stop([reason])`
Stops the collector manually.
- `reason` (optional): The reason for stopping the collector. Defaults to `"nothing"`.

### `collector.emit(event, ...args)`
Emits an event with optional arguments.
- `event`: The name of the event to emit.
- `args`: Optional arguments to pass to the event listeners.

### `collector.total`
A read-only property that returns the total number of collected interactions.

### `collector.first`
A read-only property that returns the first collected interaction.

### `collector.last`
A read-only property that returns the last collected interaction.


## MessageCollector
The `MessageCollector` class allows you to collect messages from a specific channel.

### Usage
Here is an example of how to use the `MessageCollector` class:

```javascript
const { MessageCollector } = require('eris-collects');

// Create an instance of the collector
const collector = new MessageCollector(client, {
  channel: channel, // The channel to collect messages from
  filter: (message) => message.content.includes('hello'), // Optional filter function
  time: 60000 // Optional time limit in milliseconds
});

// Listen for the 'collect' event


collector.on('collect', (message) => {
  console.log(`Collected message ${message.id}`);
});

// Listen for the 'end' event
collector.on('end', (messages, reason) => {
  console.log(`Collector ended. Collected ${messages.length} messages. Reason: ${reason}`);
});

// Stop the collector manually
collector.stop();
```

### API
The `MessageCollector` class provides the same methods and properties as the `InteractionCollector` class. Please refer to the `InteractionCollector` API documentation for more details.
